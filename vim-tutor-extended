     If any of these are totally unfamiliar, go back to vimtutor and catch up.

     Just like vimtutor, this document is intended to be used interactively.
     Please try all the excersises, and even more importantly, try to use them
     in your day-to-day text editing.

     Do not rush. You will learn best if you do one section at a time, and try
     to apply what you learn in real situations. Don't move on until

          - you learn to use the command without thinking too hard,
	    or
	  - you decide you don't really want to use it anyway.

     You don't have to learn everything, just the parts you find useful.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 8: FILLING IN THE BLANKS

     Vimtutor introduces many commands, but skips closely related alternate
     commands. This section will introduce the alternate versions of the
     commands you already know. It should also help reinforce your knowledge.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       Lesson 8.1: PAGING AND BACKSPACING

  1. In Lesson 1 you learned to move around with h,j,k,l. Press j and k to
     move down and up.

  2. Now we'll try <C-D> and <C-U>. These move your cursor and screen down
     and up by half a page at a time. Browse the document and come back.

NOTE: <C-D> means CTRL-D, that is, press the control key and the letter D.

  3. Lesson 1 also taught you to use x to delete characters. Upper-case X is
     similar, but deletes the preceding character. Use x and X to fix up the
     sentence marked ---> below.

NOTE: Use u to undo if you make a mistake.

---> I want somQQe ice creQam nowQQQQQ.

NOTE: Typically, the upper-case version of a command in normal mode does
      something similar, but different.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 8.2: MANY WAYS TO INSERT MODE

	     ** Press I to insert at the beginning of the line. **
       ** Press C to chop off the end of the line and insert new text. **

  1. You know to use i, a, and A to insert, append, and append at the end of
     the line. Try these again.

  2. There are many other ways into Insert mode. Move your cursor to the
     middle of the first line marked ---> below.

  3. Press  k  to go one line up.

  4. Press  I  to insert the beginning of the sentence and make it look like
     the line below it.

  5. Press <ESC> to leave insert mode.

  6. Move your cursor to the W on the second line marked --->.

  7. Press  C  to chop off the end of the line, and then type it in correctly.

     of this sentence is missing.
---> The beginning of this sentence is missing.
---> The end of this senWQEEXNMOXQXEMDF MSFMP IEXMXPFD!
---> The end of this sentence is now ungarbled.

NOTE:     I           Insert text at the beginning of the line, but after any
	              whitespace.
	  C  c$       Delete the rest of the line and enter insert mode.
	  S  cc       Delete the whole line and enter insert mode.
          s           Delete one character and enter insert mode. If there is
	              a visual selection, delete that.

NOTE: All these letters enter insert mode:  a A i I s S c C o O

NOTE: R  enters replace mode, which is similar to insert mode.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			   Lesson 8.3: WORD MOVEMENTS

	      ** Use the W, B, and E keys to move among words. **

     Movements commands can be used alone, just to move, or after an operator,
     to influence what it operates on.

     Lesson 2 taught you that  w  moves to the next word, while  dw  deletes
     to there.

  1. Move the cursor just after the ---> below.

  2. Press  w, W, b, B, e, and E  to move forward and backword one word or
     one WORD at a time. Try them all here:

---> A sentence with words and "-WORDS-" in it.
---> Some words have *special* charac-ters or #punctuation aroun'd them.
---> When taken together, these are considered WORDS.
---> A long WORD: http://some.example.org/url.html

NOTE: w, b, and e operate on words. words can NOT have a mix of punctuation
      and alphanumeric characters. A sequence of punctuation is its own word.

NOTE: W, B, and E operate on WORDS. WORDS are only delimited by whitespace,
      and can therefore include letters, numbers, and punctuation.

      This URL is made of one WORD, or eleven words:

      WORDS:   http://some.example.org/url.html
      words:   http  ://  some  .  example  .  org  /  url  .  html

  3. Using only  W  and  B,  move your cursor to the WORD '*special*' above.
     Then press  dW  to delete the WORD.

  4. Using only  W  and  B,  move your cursor to the word 'together' above.
     Press  cw  and change it to 'combined'.

  5. Move only with  w, W, b, B, e, and E,  and make three more changes with
     these commands:  d2W  c3w  dE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		    Lesson 8.4: SENTENCE, PARAGRAPH MOVEMENT

  1. {{TODO}}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 8.5: MAGIC CHARACTERS IN SEARCH

  1. Turn on search match highlighting. Type  :set hls  and press enter.

  2. Lesson 4 taught you to use  /text  to search for text. Try searching for
     four stars (****) below by typing  /****  and press enter.

  3. Notice that you get an error. The reason for this is that some characters
     have a magic meaning in search, by default.

  4. Instead, type  /\*\*\*\*  and press enter. The  \  character removes the
     magic meaning from each star.

NOTE: Remember to use  n  and  N  to jump to the next and previous matches.

  5. Now type  /\V****  and press enter. The  \V  sequence removes the magic
     meaning from all subsequent characters.

---> Some text within which to search for **** stars and such things....
---> More text with tricky **** characters....

NOTE: The magic characters that may cause you trouble are:

            ^ $ . * [ / \ ~

NOTE: The magic that is happening is actually regular expressions. There are
      entire books on the subject, so it will not be fully explained here. For
      more information, see  :help regexp

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 8.6: MAGIC CHARACTER MEANINGS

      This section will very briefly describe the meanings of the default
      magic characters in search (regular expressions).

            ^     This character matches the beginning of a line as though
	          that were a character. Only magic when used at the
		  beginning of the search pattern.

            $     Matches the end of a line. Only magic when used at the end
		  of the search pattern.

            .     Matches any character except a line break.

	    *     Means that the preceding character can be matched zero or
	          more times. E.g.  ba*  matches all these:
		      'b'  'ba'  'baa'  'baaa'  'baaaa'  ...

	    [     Specifies a group of characters, only one of which must
	          match. E.g.  b[eoy]  matches  'be'  or  'bo'  or  'by'.

            /     Indicates the end of the search pattern.

	    \     Removes (or adds) magic on the next character.

	    ~     Matches the last used substitute string. This helps you
	          search for  new  after a  :%s/old/new  substitution.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       Lesson 8.7: VISUAL SELECTION MODES

  1. Lesson 5 taught you that  v  enters Visual mode, in which you can select
     multiple characters.

  1. Move you cursor to the T in the first line marked ---> below.

  2. Press  v  to enter visual mode.

  3. Press  e  several times to extend the selected to the end of the next
     word.

  4. Press  o  to switch the cursor to the other end of the selection.

  5. Press  w  several times to shrink the selection by a word at a time.

  6. Press  b  several times to re-grow the selection by going back a word
     at a time. Press <ESC> when done.

---> There are three distinct visual modes:
---> Character-wise, in which you select characters in reading order,
---> Line-wise, in which you select whole lines only, and
---> Block-wise, in which you select a rectangular block of characters.

  7. Make sure your cursor is still in the ---> marked area, and press  V
     (uppercase) to enter visual line-wise mode.

  8. Press  j  and  k  until all four lines are selected.

NOTE: Notice that pressing  o  still switches to the other end.

  9. Press  d  to delete the selected lines.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 8.7: VISUAL BLOCK MODE AND MORE

  1. Move your cursor to the X on the first line below marked --->.

  2. Press  <C-V>  to enter visual block mode.

  3. Press  j  three times so that the bad characters XQZ# are all selected.

  4. Press  r,  to replace them all with commas.

  5. Press  fs  to find the next s character.

  6. Press  .  to repeat the last change.

---> A man, a planX a canals Panama!
---> A van, a planQ a canals Panava!
---> A car, a planZ a canals Paraca!
---> A nan, a bran# a lanars Banana!

NOTE: Two extremely powerful commands were sneaked into this section:
            fx     to find the next character x.
            .      to repeat a change.
      These will be explained in more detail. For now, try making some more
      visual block selections. What happens when you use  d  (delete) and
      p  (put)?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 8.8: YANK AND SHORTCUTS

  1. Lesson 6 taught you that  y  is used to yank (copy) text.

  2. {{TODO: yy Y, relation to dd cc D C etc.}}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    Lesson 9.1: KEY MAPPINGS

  1. Type this, literally, including the angle brackets, followed by return:

          :nmap <F2> ^y$:<C-R>"<CR>

     What it means:
          :nmap is a command that remaps a key or keys, in normal mode,
          <F2>  is the key to remap, it could also be a sequence of keys,
                The rest of the line is the sequence of key presses that will
		result from pressing <F2>:
          ^     goes to the beginning of the line,
          y$    yanks to the end of the line, not including the line break,
          :     is just like the one in :nmap -- it is the start of a command,
          <C-R> is control-R, which fetches the contents of a register,
          "     is the name of the register that contains the most recently
	        yanked text,
          <CR>  means Carriage Return; it completes the command.

     What it does:
          It copies the current line into command mode and executes it.

  2. Now you can run lines from this file as commands, just by pressing <F2>.

     Try it now. Move the cursor to the line below, and press <F2>:

          :nmap <C-DOWN> ddp

  3. Now if you hold Control, and press the down arrow, the line will move
     down. Use it to fix the lines below:

---> d) Can you learn too?
---> c) Intelligence is learned,
---> a) Roses are red,
---> b) Violets are blue,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     This concludes the Vim Tutor Extended.
